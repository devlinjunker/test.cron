  - Lints the shell script files with Shellcheck

  ### Cut `release-*` Branch Action (release-cut.yaml)
  - Verifies `feature` commits have been added to `develop` since last release cut
  - Creates a `release-` branch with changes in `develop`
  - Creates PR from `release-` branch into `main`

  ### On Merge to `main` Action (main-on-merge.yaml)
  - Syncs README.md files to wiki
  - Triggers after PR merges on `main` branch
  - Creates new Release Tag and Github Release on `main` branch
  - Upmerges `develop` from `main` so the tag is in `develop`s history

  ### Cut `patch-*` Branch Action (patch-cut.yaml)
  - Creates a new `patch-*` branch off of `main`, using the last tag to determine hotfix branch number and next version number

  ### PR Landmine Action (landmine.yaml)
  - Runs when comment on PR, starting with :bomb: and containing [suggestion syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#adding-line-comments-to-a-pull-request)
    - Suggestion should check if tests will catch error caused by change 
    - If the suggestion is bad, you should be able to edit the suggestion and comment on the thread to re-run the action


## Ideas
  - [x] pr mutation testing: https://github.com/tylermurry/github-pr-landmine
  - [x] build docs on merge to `main`
  - [ ] build artifacts on release (merge to `main`)
  - [ ] run build/compile in `develop-verify-merge.yaml` to ensure PR is valid
