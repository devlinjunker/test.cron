# Testing

The `qa/` directory contains files used during testing. It is named "qa" so that it will precede the `script/` and `src/` directories that it will be testing in Pull Requests.

Each feature that is added to this project should include test files that detail the expectations for the new feature. If there is a new unit testing framework needed, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/devlinjunker/dev.junk.cron/issues/new/choose).

For now this includes:
 - unit tests with BATS for script files

## Test Running Script
The `scripts/bin/` directory also contains a script file (`test.sh`) that manages running all of the test files. This will either:
 - run all tests if no arguments are passed (or `-a/--all`)
 - or will try to find a specific file to run with the `-f/--file` argument

## Other Ideas
 - integration tests
 - e2e tests
 - automation tests
 - contract tests
 - mutation tests
 - helpers?
    - BATS helper - mocking/stubbing/spying (see [here](scripts/release/release-prep-upmerge.bats))
